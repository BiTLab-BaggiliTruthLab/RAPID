# RAPID (Rapid Android Parser for Investigating DEX files) 

RAPID is an approach for speeding up the analysis process of DEX files, which released by University of New Haven Cyber Forensics Research and Education Group (UNHCFREG). 

This tool is also a JAVA library that can be implemented for faster DEX file analysis. 

RAPID Application Programming Interface (API) allows easy access to DEX data and thus researchers and practitioners can focus on things like malware detection instead of the DEX file parsing phase.
