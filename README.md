# RAPID (Rapid Android Parser for Investigating DEX files) is an approach for speeding up the analysis process of DEX files. 
# This tool is also a JAVA library that can be implemented for faster DEX file analysis. 
# RAPID Application Programming Interface (API) allows easy access to DEX data and thus researchers and practitioners can focus on things like malware detection instead of the DEX file parsing phase.
